============

This script uses last phase outputs and analsyses them.
so its inputs are:
1. FCG 
2. CFG foreach function
3. Statement type foreach function
4. Expression type foreach function

and do the Following:
	1. 	Reads FCG
	2.	Finds its cycles
	3.	Remove its cycles and adds recursive penalty to recursive function
	4.	sorts it topologically 
	5.	Foreach funtion from down to top do the following
	5.1.	Reads CFG
	5.2.	Finds its cycles
	5.3.	Remove its cycles and adds loop penalty to node
	5.4.	sorts it topologically
	5.5.	sums up each nodes risk from down to top
	5.6.	saves nodes, branches risk and update function risk
	6.	save functions risk
